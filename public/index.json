Select Support Plan In the Select a support plan page, select an effective plan, to compare plans, see Compare AWS Support Plans. Wait for your account to be activated After selecting Support plan, the account is usually activated after a few minutes, but the process can take up to 24 hours. You will still be able to log in to your AWS account at this time, the AWS Home page may show a “Complete Sign Up” button during this time, even if you have completed all the steps in the registration section. After receiving an email confirming your account has been activated, you can access all AWS services. Important The following AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions will reach the end of standard support on July 2023: aws-portal:ModifyAccount and aws-portal:ViewAccount. See the Using fine-grained AWS Billing actions to replace these actions with fine-grained actions so you have access to AWS Billing, AWS Cost Management, and AWS accounts consoles.\nIf you created your AWS account or AWS Organizations Management account before March 6, 2023, the fine-grained actions will be effective starting July 2023. We recommend you to add the fine-grained actions, but not remove your existing permissions with aws-portal or purchase-orders prefixes.\nIf you created your AWS account or AWS Organizations Management account on or after March 6, 2023, the fine-grained actions are effective immediately.\nAWS assigns the following unique identifiers to each AWS account:\nAWS account ID: A 12-digit number, such as 012345678901, that uniquely identifies an AWS account. Many AWS resources include the account ID in their Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The account ID portion distinguishes resources in one account from the resources in another account. If you\u0026rsquo;re an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console using either the account ID or account alias. While account IDs, like any identifying information, should be used and shared carefully, they are not considered secret, sensitive, or confidential information.\nCanonical user ID: An alpha-numeric identifier, such as 79a59df900b949e55d96a1e698fbacedfd6e09d98eacf8f8d5218e7cd47ef2be, that is an obfuscated form of the AWS account ID. You can use this ID to identify an AWS account when granting cross-account access to buckets and objects using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). You can retrieve the canonical user ID for your AWS account as either the root user or an IAM user.\nYou must be authenticated with AWS to view these identifiers.\nWarning Do not provide your AWS credentials (including passwords and access keys) to a third party that needs your AWS account identifiers to share AWS resources with you. Doing so would give them the same access to the AWS account that you have.\n"

	"content": "Creating your first AWS account Overview In this first lab, you will be creating your new AWS account and use Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) to improve your account security. Next, you will create an Administrator Group and Admin User to manage access to resources in your account instead of using the root user. Finally, we will step through account authentication with AWS Support in the event you experience authentication problems.\nAWS Account An AWS account is the basic container for all the AWS resources you can create as an AWS customer. By default, each AWS account will have a root user. The root user has full access within your AWS account, and root user permissions cannot be limited. When you first create your AWS account, you will be assessing it as the root user.\nAs a best practice, do not use the AWS account root user for any task where it\u0026rsquo;s not required. Instead, create a new IAM user for each person that requires administrator access. Thereafter, the users in the administrators user group should set up the user groups, users, and so on, for the AWS account. All future interaction should be through the AWS account\u0026rsquo;s users and their own keys instead of the root user. However, to perform some account and service management tasks, you must log in using the root user credentials.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA adds extra security because it requires users to provide unique authentication from an AWS supported MFA mechanism in addition to their regular sign-in credentials when they access AWS websites or services.\nIAM User Group An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. Any user in that user group automatically has the permissions that are assigned to the user group.\nIAM User An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials. Please note that an IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user.\nAWS Support AWS Basic Support offers all AWS customers access to our Resource Center, Service Health Dashboard, Product FAQs, Discussion Forums, and Support for Health Checks – at no additional charge. Customers who desire a deeper level of support can subscribe to AWS Support at the Developer, Business, or Enterprise level.\nCustomers who choose AWS Support gain one-on-one, fast-response support from AWS engineers. The service helps customers use AWS\u0026rsquo;s products and features. With pay-by-the-month pricing and unlimited support cases, customers are freed from long-term commitments. Customers with operational issues or technical questions can contact a team of support engineers and receive predictable response times and personalized support.\nMain Content Creating a new AWS Account Setting up MFA for the AWS Account root user Creating an Administrator Accounts and Groups Getting support for Account Authentication "

If you reopen your AWS account during the post-closure period (within 90 days after you close the account), you agree that the same agreement terms govern your access to and use of the service offerings through your reopened AWS account.\nAWS Management Console access Your access to the AWS Management Console for a closed AWS account is restricted. During the post-closure period, you can still sign in to your AWS account to view your past billing information and access AWS Support. You can\u0026rsquo;t access any other AWS services or start any new AWS services in the closed account.\nFind and terminate active resources To prevent unexpected charges, prior to closing your account, we recommended that you first review and terminate all applicable resources currently running in the account.\nLog in to the AWS Management Console. On the navigation pane, choose Services. On the Services page, search for Resource Groups. Under Tag Editor, in Regions, select the regions where you have created resources, or choose All regions. In Resource types, select All supported resource types. Choose Search Resources. If search results appear, then there are still active resources on the account. Note: AWS Resource Groups search results don\u0026rsquo;t show AWS Marketplace subscriptions.

For additional instructions on how to retrieve your content, see the documentation for that service.\nFor more information, see How do I check for active resources that I no longer need on my AWS account?\nExisting content and services still in use after closing After the post-closure period, AWS automatically deletes any remaining content in your AWS account, and attempts to terminate any AWS services that are still in use. For more information about the post-closure period, see Accessing your AWS account after you close it.\nYour payment method We charge you through your designated payment method for any usage fees incurred before you closed your AWS account. We issue you any refunds that might be due through that same payment method. If you have active subscriptions (such as a Reserved Instance that you pay for monthly), even after your account is closed, you might continue to be charged for the subscription through your designated payment method until the subscription expires or is sold according to the terms governing the subscription. These charges and refunds might occur after you close your account.\nIn addition, if you reopen your account, you might be charged for the cost of running AWS services (that you didn\u0026rsquo;t stop before closing your account) during the post-closure period. Closing your AWS account doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect payment methods that you use on Amazon.com or other Amazon websites.\nOn-Demand charges During the post-closure period, billing for On-Demand charges stops. However, you\u0026rsquo;re billed for any usage that has accrued up until the time you closed your account. You\u0026rsquo;ll be charged for that usage at the beginning of the next month. In addition, if you purchased any subscriptions with ongoing payment obligations, you might continue to be charged for them after your account is closed.\nImportant: You will continue to generate costs if you don\u0026rsquo;t stop or delete your resources.\nDomains registered with Amazon Route 53 Domains that are registered with Route 53 are not deleted automatically. When you close your AWS account, you have three options:\nYou can disable automatic renewal, and the domains are automatically deleted when the registration period expires. For more information, see Enabling or Disabling Automatic Renewal for a Domain.\nYou can transfer the domains to another AWS account.

For more information, see Transferring a Domain from Route 53 to Another Registrar.\nIf you already closed the account, you can open a case with AWS Support to get help with disabling automatic renewal or transferring your domains. For more information, see Contacting AWS Support About Domain Registration Issues. There is no charge to open a case for domain registration issues.\nCharges if you reopen your AWS account If you reopen your AWS account during the post-closure period, you might be billed for the cost of any AWS services that aren\u0026rsquo;t stopped or resources that aren\u0026rsquo;t deleted before you close your account.\nExample: You reopen your AWS account 30 days after closure. Your AWS account had only an active t2.micro Amazon EC2 instance at closure. For this example, imagine that the price for a t2.micro Amazon EC2 instance in your AWS Region is $0.01 per hour. In this case, you might be charged for 30 days x 24 hours x $0.01 per hour = $7.20 for your AWS services.\nCross-account access to the account you’re closing After you close your AWS account, any access requests to your closed account\u0026rsquo;s AWS services from other AWS accounts fail. This occurs even if you have granted the other accounts permission to access your account\u0026rsquo;s AWS services. If you reopen your AWS account, other AWS accounts can again access your account\u0026rsquo;s AWS services and resources if you granted the necessary permissions to the other AWS accounts.\nRemoving Amazon VPC peering connection AWS doesn\u0026rsquo;t delete Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) peering connections when you close one of the accounts participating in the VPC peering connection. Any traffic destined for the VPC peering connection originating from other active accounts is dropped because AWS terminates instances and deletes any security groups in the closed account. To remove the VPC peering connection, delete it from your account using the Amazon VPC console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or Amazon EC2 API. For more information, see Deleting a VPC Peering Connection.\nTroubleshooting errors when closing an AWS account If you receive an error message while trying to close your AWS account, you can contact your account representative or contact AWS Support to open a billing or account support case for assistance.
